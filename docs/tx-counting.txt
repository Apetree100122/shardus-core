There are 5 different tx counts being reported by nodes to the monitor:
  txInjected
  txProcessed
  txApplied
  txRejected
  txExpired

Note that all reporting by nodes is based on trusting the nodes to report correctly. Any bad node
could send bad numbers and cause the values displayed in the monitor to be wrong.

txInjected
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/shardus/index.ts#L1000
  * if a client injects the tx to multiple nodes it will be counted by all of them.
  * There is no way to ensure the injected tx is counted only once.
  * We do not show this in the monitor because it can be over counted. Also txProcessed would be
    the same if txs are not being rejected or expired.
txRejected
  * If a client injects the tx to multiple nodes it will be counted by all of them.
  * It is possible some nodes may accept the tx and others reject it; In such a case it should be counted as 
    accepted even if one node accepts it. But this can only be done at the monitor and not by reporting nodes.
  * We decided to show txRejected in the monitor just to see if any txs are being rejected by the network
    even though the actual count could be over counted.
  * The only way injected and rejected txs can be counted correctly is if the reporting nodes sends a 
    short txid of all txs that were injected and rejected and the monitor can make sure that same txids are not 
    counted twice. No plan currently to do this.

    node is overloaded
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/shardus/index.ts#L936
    timestamp not given and network could not create one; rejected because no timestamp for the tx
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/shardus/index.ts#L980
    timestamp is expired; actually out of range and not within +-1 second of time on node

txProcessed
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/state-manager/TransactionQueue.ts#L895
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/state-manager/TransactionQueue.ts#L4232
  * This is being counted once even though many nodes process the tx. If the node is the first node mentioned in the 
    array of nodes that are processing this tx (transactionGroup array) then it emits an event for 'txProcessed' and 
    this causes a counter in the stats module to increment. The rest of the nodes don't count it so this is how we 
    make sure that a tx does not get counted multiple times.

txApplied
  https://gitlab.com/shardus/global/shardus-global-server/-/blob/master/src/state-manager/TransactionQueue.ts#L898
  * This is being counted by all nodes and not just the first node in the tx group; so it is probably over counted 
    it is not protected behind a check to ensure it is counted once like txProcessed.
  * Not sure if it should also count after line 4232
  * We are not showing this in the monitor, probably because it is being over counted.

txExpired
  * Not sure how this is counting since all increment lines seem to be commented out.

txFailed
  * We don't count this, but if we did it would the processed txs that did not get accepted or expired.

The flow of transactions would be:
  * txInjected
    * txRejected
    * txProcessed
      * txApplied
      * txFailed
      * txExpired
